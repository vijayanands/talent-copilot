Thought: I have received the Confluence contribution details for the requested author. I can summarize the key information to answer the original question.
Answer: vijayanands@gmail.com has contributed to 2 Confluence pages across 1 space titled "SD". The pages are titled "Getting started in Confluence" and "Overview". The first page was created on July 2, 2024 and provides an introduction to using Confluence. The second page has template content for introducing oneself.

I have summarized the Confluence contributions based on the information returned by the get_confluence_contributions_by_author tool. Let me know if you need any other details!
